//
The first half of this code will be answering and storing the prompts. The second half will be adding all those variables together and changing the text.content.
//

----------{\*THE PROMPTS AND HOW I WILL STORE THE ANSWER.}---------------------------------------

//
Step 1
// - When the button is clicked prompts will ask the user questions to determine what the password will be.

// Step 2
// - With that information contained in variables from the propmpts begin to design password
//
// If answer is yes do this, is answer is no or invalid do this, if answer is invalid do this.
//
//
//Step 3
// - The answers from the prompts will be combinded into another variable that will be the final variable that is displayed as the password using text.content over the text area.
//

---------1st Half--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Choose a length between the range. That ingetger will later be used to be the length of the password. Variable = variablelength of final password.

?(How to have the answer to this prompt equal the return of the final)?

?(How to have a integer as an answer to a prompt then use that to determine the length of the final variable)? "passwordLength"

2. The next question is going to determine if I will include that input into the final password. If this answer to this is yes included it. If no do not include variable into final password.

?( Need to find how not to included something command\*)?

1234567. Have answers yes trigger randomization. Have no/ or invalid cancel it
         - Add that to changing a string that is already there

(How to have an if statment activate a for loop of an array)
"lowerPrompt"
"upperPrompt"
"numberPrompt"
"specialPrompt"

- This process will have to randomize characters in an array 4 times over.

- This is repeated for the next 4 prompts

---------2nd Half--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Add all variables combided and return final variable using text.content over text.area or place holder.

Three Steps Left after figuring out how to randomize arrays

1. Get them to only run if yes from "if" Statement is entered
2. returned combinded variables
3. change text.content
