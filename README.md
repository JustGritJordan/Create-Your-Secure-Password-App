# Create-Your-Secure-Password-App

## Description

The motivation for this project was to solidify new concepts learned, and to utilize API.
I built this project to simplify the users need to create a safe hard to guess password to use for any sort of password.
This solved a users issues to create a secure password.Truthfully, through this project, I was able to learn a lot more about what I didn't know rather than what I used.Also learn how quickly writing code can get out of hand. It is very easy to get lost in the logic, while getting lost in the logic you can easily forget to update on github. Comments will save your life and also save a lot of time to help you stick to your thought process.
